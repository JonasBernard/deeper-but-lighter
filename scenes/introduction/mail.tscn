how are you going?
Did you read that article in the newspaper this
morning? Barak Obama himself stated to have
seen some \"mysterious actions\" around the streets in Washington.
They have to do with some data leaks in a datacenter nearby.
But they could not give any more information, they wrote.

Isn't that strange? I mean those times. Chaotic. Just chaotic.
Lets meet at George Washington Bridge at 7PM and talk
about what happend. Will you be there?

See you

Matt"
